-- Coding Style Guide --
Please read and make sure you follow the following guidelines
before you submit a pull request

1. Use capitalized CamelCase for type names, and snake_case
for everything else.

2. Use actual tabs instead of spaces, this way programmers
can choose what tab size they want. Make sure your text
editor is set to use `hard tabs' instead of `soft tabs'.

3. Use ISO C++ 17 - super modern C++ features are often
unstable and can cause mess.

4. Use the file extension `.hpp' for C++ headers, `.h' for
C headers. Use `.cpp' for C++ source files, `.c' for C source.
This will make it easy to distinguish between C and C++, from
looking at the file names.

5. Avoid the use of `try'/`catch' blocks, as they have a large
performance penalty. `throw' is okay to use for unrecoverable
errors.

6. Don't use `using namespace std;'. It clutters the global
namespace, and is generally bad practice.
